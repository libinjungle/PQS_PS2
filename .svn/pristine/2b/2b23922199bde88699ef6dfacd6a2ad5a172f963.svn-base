1. For all methods, put what does this method do in javadocs.
2. If methods need to handle exceptions, we need to put the @Exception tag in javadocs.


AddressBook.java

Line 39:      Should specify what information needs to return.
Line 72-76:   It's better to write a helper function to check if the property belongs to each field of Person.
Line 97-106:  When methods at line 97 and 106 are both called, it is hard to tell what's the difference,
			  since they use the same method name. It is more readable if method at line 106 has the name of
			 "printAllContacts()".
Line 115:     It's a little hard to understand what does "deleteLocal()" mean. "deleteAll()" will be better.
Line 134-144: Instead of using s for all fields, it's more readable to give a meaningful name for
				each field.
Line 181:     LoadAddressBook() method better returns an AddressBook object.


Person.java
Line 2: Don't use wildcard for import.
Line 13-17: Personally, I think those fields should not be final. A person may change its address
			or phone number. We may update the person's information in the future if anything changes.
